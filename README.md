# AquaSyntaxAutoclicker
Little keybind autoclicker I made. 

Please enter a keybind to enable autoclicker when pressed.
Please use a letter key. Capitalized letters
and lowercase letters do not make a difference, but
they both work.
  
For example, if u entered 'o', the mouse would
click rapidly if you press 'o', but won't if you don't.
Feel free to minimize the program and/or switch to
a different program, as it will still run.
  
Please note that we cannot garuntee any keys
other than letter keys will work.

Thank you for using AquaSyntax Autoclicker!


please be aware, however, that it always runs until you close it.
